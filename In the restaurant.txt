I will never forget (he was, or was not,
This evening): by the fire of dawn
The pale sky is burnt and parted
And at the yellow dawn - lanterns.

I was sitting by the window in a crowded room.
Somewhere bows were singing about love.
I sent you a black rose in a glass
As golden as the palate, ai.

You looked. I met with embarrassment and boldness
Arrogant gaze and bowed.
Turning to the gentleman, deliberately sharply
You said, "And this one is in love."

And now the strings sounded in response,
Bows sang frenziedly ...
But you were with me with all the young contempt,
A slightly noticeable shake of the hand ...

You rushed with the movement of a frightened bird,
You passed as if my dream is light ...
And the perfume sighed, eyelashes dozed,
Anxious silk whispered.

But from the depths of the mirrors you threw me eyes
And, throwing, she shouted: "Catch! .."
A monisto strummed, the gypsy danced
And screamed at the dawn of love.
