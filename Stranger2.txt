In the evenings over restaurants
The hot air is wild and deaf
And rules drunken shouts
Spring and pernicious spirit.

Far above the dust of the alley
Over the boredom of country cottages,
The bakery's pretzel is a little gilded,
And the crying of children is heard.

And every evening, behind the barriers,
Breaking the bowlers
Ladies walk among the ditches
Tried and tested wit.

Oarlocks creak over the lake
And there is a woman's screeching
And in the sky, accustomed to everything
The disc bends senselessly.

And every night the only friend
Reflected in my glass
And moisture tart and mysterious,
As me, humble and deafened.

And next to the neighboring tables
Sleepy lackeys stick out
And drunks with rabbit eyes
"In vino veritas!" * Shout.

And every evening at the appointed hour
(Or is this only my dream?)
Maiden's camp, captured by silks,
In the foggy window moves.

And slowly, passing between the drunks,
Always without companions, alone
Breathing with spirits and mists
She sits by the window.

And they blow with ancient beliefs
Her elastic silks
And a hat with mourning feathers
And in the rings is a narrow hand.

And chained by a strange closeness,
Looking beyond the dark veil
And I see the coast enchanted
And an enchanted distance.

Deaf secrets are entrusted to me,
Someone's sun is handed to me
And all the souls of my bend
A tart wine pierced.

And ostrich feathers bowed
In my brain swaying
And deep blue eyes
Blossom on the distant shore.

There is a treasure in my soul
And the key is entrusted only to me!
You really are a drunken monster!
I know: the truth is in wine.
